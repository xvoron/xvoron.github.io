Lev Landau established so called theoretical minimum exams; two in math and nine
in theoretical physics (one for each volume). This link has information about
these exams (it is in English but all the links lead to Russian pages): Chair
for "Problems in theoretical physics"

<p>
If you pass maths exams you should be able to handle most of the physics. I
translated the requirements for each of the math exams for you from Russian in
case you don't know it:
</p>

<p>
Math 1:
You should be fluent computing indefinite integrals and solving ordinary
differential equations. You should know Vector calculus  and Tensor calculus.
</p>

<p>
Math 2:
Complex analysis, should be able to use Cauchy's integral theorem to compute
integrals, solution of equations using Methods of contour integration  (Laplace
transform), computation of asymptotic behavior of integrals, Special functions
(Legendre polynomials , Bessel function, Elliptic function , Hypergeometric
function, Gamma function ).
The subjects in Math 1 curriculum were usually studied during the first and
second year of the undergraduate program at the school from which the above
institution recruits theoretical physics majors. The subjects in Math 2 were
covered during second and third year if my memory serves me right. Stronger
students were able to pass the math exams earlier.
